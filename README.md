## Introduction

IP Adapter Art is a specialized version that uses a professional style encoder. Its goal is to achieve style control through reference images in the text-to-image diffusion model and solve the problems of instability and incomplete stylization of existing methods. This is a preprint version, and more models and training data coming soon.

## How to use

[![**IP Adapter Art Demo**](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kV7q3Gzr8GPG9cChdDQ5ncCx84TYjuu3?usp=sharing)  can be used to conduct experiments directly.

For local experiments, please refer to a [demo](https://github.com/aihao2000/IP-Adapter-Artist/blob/main/ip_adapter_art_sdxl_demo.ipynb).

Local experiments require a basic torch environment and dependencies:

```
pip install diffusers
pip install transformers
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
pip install git+https://github.com/aihao2000/IP-Adapter-Art.git
```
